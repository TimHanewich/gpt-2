GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) is a large neural network language model developed by OpenAI. It was trained on a diverse corpus of text data, consisting of over 45 terabytes of text from a wide range of sources, including web pages, books, and articles.

The training data used for GPT-2 was curated to represent a broad range of writing styles, topics, and genres. The dataset includes both fiction and non-fiction, as well as texts from different time periods and regions of the world.

One of the unique features of GPT-2's training is that it was unsupervised, meaning that the model was trained on the raw text data without any human annotations or labels. This allowed the model to learn patterns and structures in language on its own, which is one of the reasons why it is able to generate coherent and diverse text in response to prompts.

It's worth noting that due to the size and complexity of the training data used for GPT-2, the model has the potential to reflect any biases or inaccuracies that are present in the data. This is an important consideration when using or evaluating the model's output.
